#		SCRIPT TO DEFINE RELEASE SPECIFIC INFORMATION
#               =============================================

# Script must be sourced, since it sets up environment variables for the
# parent script.

# Defines the RELEASE, LOGDIR and RESDIR environment variables, creating the
# LOGDIR and RESDIR directories if they don't exist.

# The following pre-requisites must be defined

# basedir

#     The directory containing all the sources. Log and results files are
#     created within this directory.

# Epiphany releases have the naming convention:

#   <year>.<month>[.<patch>]
RELEASE_MAJOR="2014"
RELEASE_MINOR="11"
RELEASE_PATCH=""

# The full release version
RELEASE="${RELEASE_MAJOR}.${RELEASE_MINOR}${RELEASE_PATCH}"

# Create a common log directory for all logs in this and sub-scripts
LOGDIR=${basedir}/logs/${RELEASE}
mkdir -p ${LOGDIR}

# Create a common results directory in which sub-directories will be created
# for each set of tests.
RESDIR=${basedir}/results/${RELEASE}
mkdir -p ${RESDIR}

# Export the environment variables
export RELEASE
export LOGDIR
export RESDIR
