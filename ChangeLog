	'build-toolchain.sh' to install the build-host toolchain inside
	the 'builds' directory. Do not install to '/opt/adapteva'. This
	would break the build when the user did not have write permissions.

	we're in detached state. If possible, use the original branch
	name [which originates from a components definition file so it better
	exist] before adjusting for release tag, as a first guess. That
	should be better than checking out an arbitrary branch performance-wise.

2014-10-31  Ola Jeppsson  <ola@adapteva.com>

	* setup.csh: Fix undefined MANPATH warning

2014-10-31  Ola Jeppsson  <ola@adapteva.com>

	get-versions.sh. Also pass 'toolchain-components' to get-versions.sh

	toolchain components.
	* sdk-components: New file. Add definitions for epiphany-libs and
	parallella-linux.
	* define-release.sh: Slight change of version numbering. Add
	comments. Export RELEASE_TAG.
	* download-toolchain.sh: Support release flag. Replace hardcoded
	component downloads with one call to new download_components
	function.
	(github_tool): Add (optional) release prefix paramater. Adjust for
	tag release prefix parameter (if any) when "--release" is set.
	We need to do this for repositories with multiple heads (currently
	only 'epiphany-binutils-gdb'.
	(download_components): New function. It will download all
	toolchain components defined in 'toolchain-components'.
	* get-versions.sh: Add mandatory componentfile argument. Support
	release flag. Adjust release prefix parameter if needed when in
	release mode.
	* install-sdk.sh: Remove -d flag. Rename --release flag to
	--no-debug. Add new --release flag for release mode. Use
	get-components.sh to checkout right version SDK components defined
	in 'sdk-components'.

2014-10-30  Ola Jeppsson  <ola@adapteva.com>

	* setup.sh: Add MANPATH
	* setup.csh: Likewise

	toolchain.
	* component-versions: Track the Epiphany multicore simulator
	branch.
	* download-toolchain.sh: Add option to download multi-core
	simulator.

2014-10-28  Jeremy Bennett  <jeremy.bennett@embecosm.com>

	* build-toolchain.sh: Remove RPATH functionality. Irrelevant to a
	static toolchain.

2014-10-24  Ola Jeppsson  <ola@adapteva.com>

	* install-sdk.sh: Don't install sudo wrapper scripts

2014-10-24  Ola Jeppsson  <ola@adapteva.com>

	* build-toolchain.sh: Add staging directory for things we need for
	building but don't want to include in the SDK.
	Install ncurses to staging area so it doesn't end up in the SDK.
	Skip building and installing things we don't need from ncurses.
	Use system's terminfo path as fallback.
	* build-epiphany-sdk.sh: Add two new flags, one (-d) for enabling
	debug symbols and (-C) for cleaning before building. Make sure
	they propagate throughout the whole build process.
	* install-sdk.sh: Add clean flag (-C, --clean).

	* install-sdk.sh: Remove the following flags: -a, --arch, --arm,
	--x86, -t and --toolprfx. --host <arch-triplet> is sufficient now.
	Use uname to figure out buildarch automatically.  Compare
	buildarch and hostarch to determine if we're cross-compiling. If
	we are, make sure to set the right PATH so we use the
	buildarch->targetarch compiler (and not hostarch->targetarch
	compiler).  Verify that buildarch->targetarch toolchain is
	present.  If we're doing Canadian cross, verify that
	buildarch->hostarch toolchain is present.
	* build-epiphany-sdk.sh: Pass hostarch triplet to install-sdk.sh
	when doing Canadian cross compilation.
	* build-toolchain.sh: Use uname to determine buildarch.  Install
	newlib for buildarch->targetarch compiler when doing Canadian
	cross compilation. Some header files were missing
	(e.g. <sys/types.h>).
